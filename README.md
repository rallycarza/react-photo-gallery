# Responsive Photo Gallery 

This photo gallery was built using React Hooks and Cloudinary.

# Front End

This project was intended to help me develop skills beyond vanilla JavaScript and try my hand at a framework.
I chose to build this photo gallery entirely using React Hooks, as this seems to be the way that most modern web apps are trending.

# Back End

I used this project as an opportunity to learn the basics of APIs and media management. I utilized Cloudinary for photo storage, using their documentation as a guide to connect my web application. Node.JS was used for the API.

# Skills learned in this project

This project gave me great insight into the benefits of React over vanilla JavaScript, and it was fun to use my Web Development skills to create something that feels a few steps above a traditional static web page. Examples of specific items that I feel improved my development abilities include:

- Learning the benefit of Hooks over traditional components
- Server-side language
- Implementing fun design aspects, such as react-icons and framer-motion
- Using react-router-dom (although this ended up as a single page web app, I know how to use this in the future)
- Building a web app from scratch, including choosing the best framework to use for the concept I have
- Writing a script to implement next_cursor since the Cloudinary API caps out at 10 assets
- Learning to use Postman to visualize JSON data and set parameters for API GET calls

# Summary

I enjoyed learning React, and am very likely to continue learning and using this. I also want to get more involved with APIs and databases to better understand the backend of my future projects.
